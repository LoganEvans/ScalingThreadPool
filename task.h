//
// The scaling logic controls how many tasks from each Executor may be in each
// of the three active states. A low-latency Executor will be able to have
// tasks in a prioritized state, but cannot have tasks in a running state.
// Conversely, a normal Executor can have tasks in a running state, but cannot
// have tasks in a prioritized state.
//
// The number of tasks from each Executor allowed in the running/prioritized
// states is at least equal to the thread_weight configuration for the
// Executor. However, the scaling logic may temporarily increase the limit if
// the tasks are not consuming their resources. This is intended to allow extra
// IO-bound threads to run with a normal nice value. If an excess number of
// threads are running and then start to consume an unfair share of the
// resources, extra tasks will be throttled with a nice value of 20.
//
// A task can be started in a throttled state if the system has an excess of
// resources but the Executor has reached its limit for tasks in a
// running/prioritized state.
